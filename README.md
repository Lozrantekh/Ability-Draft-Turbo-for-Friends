Well if you have come across this Github repository you probably are searching for the Workshop mod Ability-Draft-Turbo-for-Friends.
Had to take it down, as keymil does not want people to update his mods.
So I leave this here so you can use the Workshop tools to privately use this version with your friends or do whatever.

Simply follow the normal workshop guides to create a new mod and drop the content and game folder in the newly named mod respectively.
Don't forget to drop the current dota 2 map vpk file into the new mod folder and let it compile. Afterwards the game mode should function as it did before.
